# rising software assessment

# installation

`npm install`

# usage

## storybook

I developed the components using a component driven development approach and once I was happy with what I had, I wired it all up into the app

`npm run storybook`

## app

`npm run serve`

## error state

Change the url of any of the http requests in order to have the server return 404 to see the error state

## todo

- [ ] perform self review and tidy up where appropriate
- [ ] wire up custom date range to filter assessment results accordingly
